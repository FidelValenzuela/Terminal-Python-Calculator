# Terminal Python Calculator

This Python script is a command-line calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

## Features

- Add two numbers
- Subtract two numbers
- Multiply two numbers
- Divide two numbers (checks for division by zero)
- Exponentiate two numbers

## How It Works

1. The user selects an operation from the menu:
   - 1: Add
   - 2: Subtract
   - 3: Multiply
   - 4: Divide
   - 5: Exponentiate
2. The script prompts the user to enter two numbers.
3. Based on the selected operation, it performs the calculation and displays the result.
4. If division by zero is attempted, an error message will display instead of a result.

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```
2. Follow the prompts to select an operation and input numbers.
